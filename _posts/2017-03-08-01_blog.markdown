# Verifying News: First Blog

## Overview

The end goal for our project is designing an algorithm for accurately verifying the authenticity of a news article at a given URL. User’s will be able to employ this algorithm through a chrome extension and web app. A figure outlining our current proposed approach is below.

## What We’ve Accomplished

We wanted to ensure we had a solid plan going forward so invested our resources in reviewing and updating our goals (see timeline below). We reviewed the information and methods of acquiring data from Webhose.io in order to design an efficient database schema (below). We also have secured funds from Brown University for our API calls and storage via the Explore Grant. We have also transitioned to Microsoft’s DreamSpark for students to store our data. Before the midterm report we hope to add some data to our relational databases following our schema and run some basic analyses.

## Tentative Database Schema

Our tentative Star Schema diagram which displays how we plan to save our data is below. All the data metrics are already available through webhose.io given a news article URL.
